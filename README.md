## ⚙️ How it Works

- **Load Audio:** The script loads your `.mp3` files effortlessly.
- **Visualize Waveforms:** View and save the original waveform of your audio as crisp, clean PNG images.
- **Transform & Reverse:** Watch the magic happen when the audio is reversed, and visualize the transformed signal.
- **Merge Signals:** Get creative by merging parts of the waveform—create complex signals with just a few lines of code!
- **Save & Share:** The output images are ready to be shared or further analyzed.
